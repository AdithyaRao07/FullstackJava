This is the 1st project while learning Spring 
I Created a simple Spring Boot project and learnt how dependency injection works
I created a Alien class and laptop class and learnt that by using spring we don't need to create and manage objects manually spring boot will take care of them
Learnt about annotations like Component and Autowired
In the next project we'll learn in detail about beans and what is done in background of this springboot project code.
